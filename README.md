# PCB-111000_1
Plug in version of PCB-111000 for use with Arduino Uno pcb.
Project PCB-111000 (published in October 2018) is a pcb designed to introduce beginners to programming Atmega devices in C.
The PCB contained two Atmega devices, a USAB bridge and an 8 digit seven segment display.
One of the Atmega devices hosts user projects, the other hosts a mini_OS and programmer code.  The min-OS drives the display.
The two IC's communicate over the I2C bus.

To simplify pcb assembly a new and simplified version PCB-11000_1 is to be developed.
This contains the display and the Atmega which hosts the mini-OS and programmer.
The UNO board provides the USB bridge and Atmega device used to host user projects.
