***************************************************

A NEW PATTERN GENERATOR THAT USES ALL THE LEDS 



IT INTRODUCES

The project I2C subroutines "I2C_Tx_any_segment(segment, digit_num)" and "I2C_Tx_any_segment_clear_all()"

Note: 
1.	The segments are labelled "a" to "g" and "segment - 'a'" takes on the values 0 to 6
Digits are labelled 0 to 7 and writing to a led toggles it on or off.

2.	Logic required to backup the display may looks a bit tricky and require paper and pencil to get it.
