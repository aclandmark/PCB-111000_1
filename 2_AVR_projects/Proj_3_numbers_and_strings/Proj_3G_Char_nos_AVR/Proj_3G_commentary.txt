USES THE DISPLAY TO EXPLORE THE OPERATION OF BINARY NUMBERS



IT INTRODUCES



1.  Binary notation for unsigned integers from 0 to 255 and signed integers between -128 and +127.

2.  Project subroutine "I2C_Tx_display_char(digit, mode)" where digit is any binary number between 0 and 11111111 
and mode is either "u" for unsigned or "s" for signed.


OPERATION

The 4 LHS digits of the display are used to display the binary number and the 4 RHS digits for the decimal number.
Press sw2 to increment the binary number or sw1 to decrement it.
sw3 toggles the display between "signed" and "unsigned" numbers.

Switch location on PCB:  SW1 - SW2 - SW3
