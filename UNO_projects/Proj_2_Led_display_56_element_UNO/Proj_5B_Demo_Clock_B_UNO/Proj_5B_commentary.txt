INTRODUCES 

1.	Resources subroutine I2C_Tx_8_byte_array() which sends an array of 8 askii characters (0 to 9) to the 8 digit display.

2.	A basic clock mechanism

The timer T0 generates a one second tick that is used to increment the variable sec_counter and also call the subroutine Display_time().

Subroutine Display_time()
	Resets the sec_counter afetr 12 hours (43200 seconds).
	Converts the number of seconds to hours, minutes and seconds
	Calls the timer_unsigned to askii subroutine to covert hours, minutes and seconds to three 2 character strings.

Note: #define statements in the clock_stop_watch.h header file, map the labels HoursH and L, MinsH and L and SecsH and L to digits [2] to [7] so that the clock can be displayed using a I2C_Tx_8_byte_array() subroutine.
