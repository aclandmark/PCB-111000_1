"Instructions for preparing a text file containing strings and numbers that can  be saved to the EEPROM using 'UNO_programmer' and read using the project 'Text_reader'.  
This project contains the subroutines that will be required by user applications.

Only two quotation symbols are allowed in the text file.

Everything ahead of the first quotation symbol is ignored. Every thing ater the second is ignored except decimal and hex numbers.

Compose the text strings and save them as a .txt file. The return key is used to terminate each string.
Use Arduino to download 'UNO_programmer' to a UNO board. Connect the target device and open a terminal program.
At the s...s...s...... user prompt press s, e, w, 0 and send the text file when requested.
It may have to be sent several times depending on its size.
At the 'AK' prompt press any key and the file will be echoed to the PC along with the address of each string.
Type the address below the second quotation symbol and then add any other numbers that are to be saved."
